Lab 12 Description: Testing your game (1-2 hours)
This is a group project.  (Each team creates one product collaboratively, each student submits an identical product using their iLearn account.)

Today's lab builds on top of the strategy game you started last time.

Remember to submit lab #11 before working on this assignment! 
Warm-Up

One additional thing that can make your code easier to read and understand is comments!  (Remember that comments are human-readable notes that you put in your code that get ignored by Python, you start a comment with a #)

Add comments to your code so that someone unfamiliar with your program would be able to look at the code and understand how it is working.  At a minimum, each function should have a comment explaining its purpose
Part 1 : Add on to your game

Right now, your adventure game is probably pretty simple.  For last time you just needed to have navigation, plus one additional add on.  Let's add some more complexity to make the game a little more fun

(a) Add two items that the user must some how get in one room and use in another - add some hints to the text so that players are clued in to what/where the useful objects are.  You can be creative about what objects you add and how the user should use them

(b) Add a win condition to your game.  There should be some way for the user to win.  Maybe they have a task to accomplish or maybe they just need to make it to a specific room with a specific set of items

(c) Add a lose condition. There should also be some way for the player to lose your game.  

(d) Add a secret room.  There should be some way for a player to access your secret room, but it doesn't need to be totally obvious.
Part 2: Make sure it works :)

Use the techniques covered in debugging techniques page to thoroughly debug your code!
